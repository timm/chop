onventions:

- Source code
  - All source code in one file.
    - All locals listed at top;
    - Application specific code at top;
    - General utilities at bottom,
    - Unit tests under nearly everything  else,  inside the `Eg` variable.
    - Second last is the main function to be called if this code is _not_ included into
      another library:
      - And I test for that using `not pcall(debug.getlocal, 4, 1)`.
    - Finally, there  is a return statement that exports the more useful parts of the code.
  - No globasl (so keep the list of `local`s at top of file up to date).
  - The `the` local handles information and defaults shared across all functions and classes.
    - And this variable is initialized by parsing the [Usage](#usage) section of this help
      text/
  - Minimize use of the `local` keyword (so ugly)
    - Use it once at top of file.
    - Then (usually) define function locals as extra input arguments.
  - Indent code with 2 characters for tabs.
  - Using classes to divide the code. 
    - Update the non-class library code rarely (since that is functions global to the module).
    - Update the class code a lot.
  - Classes:
    - Use classes for polymorphism. 
    - Don't use inheritance (adds to debugging effort).
    - Classes are created by assigning some defaults to a global value;    
      e.g. `Emp={lname="", fname="", add=address() }`
    - Class constructors are lower case functions that call `isa(X)` 
      (where `X` is some class).
      - Typically for some `Klass`, the constrictor is the same name, starting with lower case (e.g. `klass`).
      - Constructors often use the idiom `new.x = y or the.zzz.y` where `y` is a parameter- S
